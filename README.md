# Sumde-Hacks
This is my repository where all my hacks for games on https://sumde2.com go!

## How to use
The first thing that you want to do is to go into the folder on the game that you want. ex: You want to get hacks for burger clicker, In that case you will click the burger clicker folder, Then it will provide a list of files full of hacks for that game. Once you find the hack you like you can click on the file and copy all of the javascript code. Once you have done that go to the website game and right click anywhere on the webpage, Click inspect, Look at the top and click "Console", Then paste your code in. And volia! You are now done learning how to hack! ðŸ¥‡

Also you can change values as you want as well.
